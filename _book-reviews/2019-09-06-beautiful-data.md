Another book I just finished is [Beautiful Data: The Stories Behind Elegant Data Solutions](https://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Data-Stories-Elegant-Solutions/dp/0596157118/). This book is a bit unusual in that, rather than being written by a single author, instead each chapter is written by a different person or group. The common thread tying all the chapters together is *data* - data collection, analysis, and presentation. The book was published a few years ago, in 2009, so some of the technology discussed is a bit dated. But it still provides a valuable historical perspective.

Most of the chapters were quite interesting, but here are a few of my favorites:
* **Embedded Image Data Processing on Mars**, in which the author talks about the challenges of collecting and processing image data on the extremely limited computer aboard one of the Mars rovers. Fascinating!
* **Cloud Storage Design**, in which the authors, who worked on building a distributed cloud database platform at Yahoo!, explain the challenges they faced.
* **Building Radiohead's House of Cards**, in which the authors explain how they used LIDAR imaging and data processing techniques to create the mesmerizing graphics in a famous music video.
* **Natural Language Corpus Data**, in which the author talks about the origins of Google's n-gram project, and various applications of the data.
* **Life in Data: The Story of DNA**, in which the authors talk about the extraordinary volumes of data produced by the human genome sequencing project, and how the data was processed and analyzed.
* **Exploring Millions of Social Stereotypes**, in which the authors used a database of 100k face images and 10M tags to explore relationships between and clustering of descriptive words.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in both the theory and nuts-and-bolts of data analysis. A long but enjoyable read!
