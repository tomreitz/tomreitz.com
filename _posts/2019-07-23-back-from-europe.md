*Posted July 23, 2019*

I haven't posted since April, which is because my wife and I had the opportunity to travel through Europe for 10 weeks! If you'd like, you can read more about our adventures [here](http://www.traceyandtom.com/europe-2019). Now that I'm back, I plan to resume writing here occasionally.

I am also very pleased to announce that I've been accepted to the [Professional Masters Program](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/professional-masters-program-2/) at the [Computer Science department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) of [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). I'm looking forward to taking a few classes on campus  starting in September.

On, Wisconsin!
