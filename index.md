Hey there, I'm Tom Reitz. On this blog, you will find my book reviews, data analysis, technical articles, and other musings. 
Please [contact me](mailto:tom@tomreitz.com) if you have any questions or just want to say hi. I love meeting new people, 
building strong relationships, and having interesting conversations!

I am currently a data engineer at [Education Analytics](https://www.edanalytics.org/). I work to design, build, and maintain 
automated data pipelines and analytic systems to help improve pulbic K-12 education.

Previously (from October 2013 to February 2022), I worked for [Ballotpedia](https://ballotpedia.org/) as lead developer and 
solutions architect. I rebuilt technical infrastructure to accommodate election-related traffic spikes of over 1M pageviews 
per hour. I also built a political information database and [API](https://api.ballotpedia.org/) which power the 
[Sample Ballot Lookup](https://ballotpedia.org/Sample_Ballot_Lookup) and provide data to partners like Facebook and Twitter.

I also do consulting through my company [Reitz Tech](https://reitztech.com/), which helps startups, non-profits, and small 
businesses to realize impactful technical projects.

I live in Madison, Wisconsin (where I grew up). Madison is a small but growing midwest city. It has beautiful lakes and parks, 
kind people, and lots of things to do. My wife and I own a home on the near-west side, where we enjoy cooking and entertaining 
friends.

In 2009, I earned a bachelor's degree in computer science and math from the University of Wisconsin, and in 2021, I completed 
a master's degree with emphasis in data science at the same institution.

Thanks for checking out my website. May you have joy and peace wherever you go in life!
